                <h2>It all began in 1984 when Linnaea Phillips created a gathering place for conversation, 
                    music, social events, and, of course, sharing good food and drink. With the help of many 
                    friends, her vision of a classic coffee house became a reality, and one of the first 2nd wave
                    coffee establishments on the West Coast was born. Almost 40 years later, 
                    Linnaea's Cafe is still a beloved fixture of downtown San Luis Obispo and a popular place 
                    for both locals and out-of-towners.
                </h2>
                <img class="mobile-alt-image" src="./cafeLena.jpeg">
                <h2><br>
                    In 2008, Linnaea sold the café to her longtime  manager, Marianne Orme, and
                    in 2023, Linnaea's was sold to husband-wife duo Alex and Rusty Quirk. Rusty, a Cal
                    Poly Graduate and Michelin Guide-recognized pastry chef, and Alex, a SLO-local musician 
                    and event producer, have dedicated themselves to restoring Linnaea’s as the eclectic and welcoming 
                    center of San Luis Obispo’s coffee house culture. Linnaea’s remains a popular showcase for 
                    rising local artists and host to a variety of musical performances, poetry readings, art 
                    installations, jazz jams, and other events.

            <div class="content-box">
                <img class="content-image-right" src="./garden.jpeg">
                <h2>The Garden has been around since the cafe was founded in 1984. It became a community 
                    project when Linnaea asked friends and customers to bring in a brick or two to help build 
                    the patio floor. You can still see the signed, decorated blocks here and there, reminding 
                    us that we're all in this together--that we have the power to create community and a 
                    beautiful space for us all to enjoy and benefit from.<br><br>
                    One of our favorite things is to watch people discover the patio garden behind the coffee 
                    shop itself. They usually sound something like this: "Oh, wow, would you look at this! 
                    Amazing! It's so pretty. And there's a fish pond! No way!"<br><br>
                    People spend many a lovely hour out back in the garden, sipping lattes, catching up with 
                    friends, studying, or doing creative work in the quiet, serene space. The resident sparrows 
                    and finches come and go among the dense branches of the tropical arbor, cleaning up any 
                    muffin crumbs and taking little splash baths in the koi pools.

                <h2>San Luis Obispo (SLO, SLOtown, or San Luis) is the county seat and home  of California 
                    Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) with a population  of 45,000, about 1/3 of whom are 
                    college students. It is almost exactly  half-way (about a 4 hour drive) between Los Angeles & 
                    San Francisco,  and just a few miles from the coast, where Highways 1 and 101 meet.  It is  a 
                    quiet and beautiful town, with a very strong sense of community. The town slows down a bit during 
                    the first part of the summer, but picks up in August when Europe takes a vacation. San Luis has 
                    a beautiful downtown,  wonderful outdoor concerts during the summer, and great weather year  
                    round. We are blessed to live in such a beautiful place.
